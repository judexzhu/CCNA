## Static Routes

<img src=images\2017-09-22_23-06-25.png>

1. Configure R1 and R2 with IP address show in the diagram
2. Verify the routing table on both routers - what networks do they know how to reach 
3. Ping directly between the two routers. Are you successful?
4. ping various device on the LANs attached to the Routers. What works, what doesn't?
5. Implement static routing on the routers shown so that full connectivity is achieved.
6. BONUS: Add a secondary connection between the routers. Set up floating static routing so that redundancy is achieved.
